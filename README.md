# test_setup

**First go to the environment you would like to test, if you don't want to use your base environment.**

```
cd ~/Desktop/
mkdir test_pkg
cd test_pkg
git clone https://github.com/LukeLinEx/test_setup.git
pip install -e ./test_setup
```

You should be able to run test.ipynb no matter where you save it.
